# CycleGAN-mri-T1-to-T2-images
This contains GAN implementation on MNIST dataset and CycleGAN implementation on MRI images.
Brief about CycleGAN implementation on MRI images:-
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) provide the luxury of creating another type of MRI from the existing one. In this assignment, you will use a particular variant of GANs, called CycleGAN, to translate the style of one MRI image into another. This will help in gaining a better understanding and analysis of the scanned image. By using GANs, you will create T2 weighted images from T1 weighted MRI images and vice-versa.
There are some component types such as Water, Fat, Muscle and Tumors which establish contrast relationships between MRIs. Moreover some of the elements have different contrast levels whereas the Bone component in MRIs gets highlighted in the same way in both the MRIs. Hence we can see that itâ€™s a partial contrast but not a complete contrast. As this is not a complete list of components that are highlighted in the MRIs, to learn more about T1 and T2 images, you may visit here.
